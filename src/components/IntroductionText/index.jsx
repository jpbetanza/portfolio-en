                Graduated in Biomedical Engineering, I fell in love with the field of programming during my undergraduate studies, 
                where many of my coursework projects were focused on web development. I enjoy creating responsive and visually 
                appealing applications. While I am more involved with Front-End development, utilizing skills in React, Tailwind, 
                and Bootstrap, I also have familiarity with Back-End development, using Django and NodeJS.
